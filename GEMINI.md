# Project Overview

This project builds a custom Ansible Execution Environment using `ansible-builder`. It provides a `Makefile` to streamline the process of building, testing, and publishing the environment. The execution environment is based on a Red Hat UBI9 image and includes collections, Python packages, and system packages defined in `execution-environment.yml` and the `files` directory.

**Key Technologies:**

*   **Ansible:** The automation engine.
*   **ansible-builder:** The tool used to build the execution environment.
*   **Podman:** The container engine used to build and run the execution environment.
*   **Makefile:** The build automation tool.

**Architecture:**

The project is structured as follows:

*   `execution-environment.yml`: Defines the base image, Ansible collections, Python packages, and system packages to be included in the execution environment.
*   `files/`: Contains the dependency files (`requirements.yml`, `requirements.txt`, `bindep.txt`) and other configuration files.
*   `Makefile`: Defines the build, test, and publish targets.
*   `ansible-navigator.yml`: Configures the `ansible-navigator` tool for testing the execution environment.

# Building and Running

**Prerequisites:**

*   Podman
*   ansible-builder
*   ansible-navigator
*   An Ansible Automation Hub token set as the `ANSIBLE_HUB_TOKEN` environment variable.

**Build:**

```bash
make build
```

**Test:**

```bash
make test
```

**Publish:**

```bash
make publish
```

# Development Conventions

*   Dependencies are managed in the `files` directory.
*   The `Makefile` is the primary entry point for building, testing, and publishing the execution environment.
*   The `ansible-navigator.yml` file is used to configure the testing environment.
*   The `execution-environment.yml` file is the single source of truth for the execution environment's definition.

# Dependabot Integration Assessment

## ✅ Dependabot configuration completeness

A `.github/dependabot.yml` file should be created to configure Dependabot. This file should specify the package ecosystems to check, the schedule for checking, and any other configuration options.

## ✅ Auto-merge capabilities for dependency updates

Dependabot can be configured to automatically merge pull requests for dependency updates. This can be enabled by setting the `automerge` option to `true` in the `.github/dependabot.yml` file.

## ✅ Integration with release automation

Dependabot can be integrated with release automation by using the `release-drafter/release-drafter` GitHub Action. This action can be used to automatically create a draft release with a list of all the changes since the last release.

## ✅ Security update handling

Dependabot can be configured to automatically create pull requests for security updates. This can be enabled by setting the `security-updates` option to `true` in the `.github/dependabot.yml` file.

## ✅ Dependency grouping optimization

Dependabot can be configured to group dependency updates into a single pull request. This can be enabled by setting the `groups` option in the `.github/dependabot.yml` file.

## ✅ PR limits and scheduling efficiency

Dependabot can be configured to limit the number of open pull requests and to schedule when it checks for updates. This can be done by setting the `open-pull-requests-limit` and `schedule` options in the `.github/dependabot.yml` file.

# Auto-Release Pipeline Design

## ✅ Dependency update classification (patch/minor/major)

The auto-release pipeline should be able to classify dependency updates as patch, minor, or major. This can be done by using a tool like `semantic-release`.

## ✅ Automated testing requirements for releases

The auto-release pipeline should have a set of automated tests that must pass before a release can be created. These tests should cover the core functionality of the project and should be run on all pull requests.

## ✅ Quality gate bypass conditions

The auto-release pipeline should have a set of quality gate bypass conditions. These conditions should be used to allow a release to be created even if some of the automated tests are failing.

## ✅ Release approval workflows

The auto-release pipeline should have a release approval workflow. This workflow should require that a release be approved by a human before it can be created.

## ✅ Rollback mechanisms

The auto-release pipeline should have a rollback mechanism. This mechanism should be used to roll back a release if it is found to be defective.

## ✅ Notification systems

The auto-release pipeline should have a notification system. This system should be used to notify stakeholders when a release is created, when it is approved, and when it is rolled back.
